# C Calculator

This project is a basic usage of C in order to make a basic 4-function calculator.

I am using this project in order to get better at C. The endgoal here is to be able to make my own physical calculator.

## Current goal

The current goal of this project is to make a 4-function calculator.
In the future we will make a scientific calculator but this is a good start.
We will use ![this](https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-TI-108-Elementary/dp/B001F0271O) calculator as an example

NOTE: one key difference in this calculator is the function of =. = is only displaying, not redoing the last operation.
